I worked on this project with the following 

1- abstracted network layer with repository pattern to handle datasource types
2- I used swiftUI as ui framework instead of UIKit
3- I used MVVM design architecture pattern with BaseViewModel
4- implement unit test for all cases 
5- I used SwiftLint for listing of code to grantee clean code formatting
